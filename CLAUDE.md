# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

**##important note**
There's a file modification bug in Claude Code. The workaround is: always use complete absolute Windows paths with drive letters and backslashes for ALL file operations. Apply this rule to all file opperations going forward. 
## Project Overview

RimWorld Access is a MelonLoader mod for RimWorld that adds comprehensive keyboard accessibility features for visually impaired players. The mod uses Harmony patches to intercept UI rendering and input handling, providing direct screen reader support via the Tolk library and keyboard navigation throughout the game.

## Build Commands

**Build the mod:**
```bash
dotnet build
```

The build process automatically copies the compiled DLL and required
dependencies to a `Mods` directory inside the game's installation directory via a
post-build target.

**Deployed files:**
- `rimworld_access.dll` - The mod
- `Tolk.dll` - Screen reader bridge library
- `nvdaControllerClient64.dll` - NVDA communication library

**Note:** Audio files in the `Sounds/` folder are automatically embedded into the DLL during build.

**Target Framework:** .NET Framework 4.7.2

## Architecture

### MelonLoader Integration
- Entry point: `rimworld_access.cs` - defines the `RimWorldAccessMod` class that inherits from `MelonMod`
- On initialization (OnInitializeMelon), creates a Harmony instance and applies all patches automatically via `harmony.PatchAll()`
- Harmony ID: `com.rimworldaccess.mainmenukeyboard`

### Core Design Pattern: State + Patch

The mod follows a consistent architectural pattern:
- **State classes** (`*State.cs`) - Maintain navigation state, track selections, and manage keyboard input
- **Patch classes** (`*Patch.cs`) - Harmony patches that intercept RimWorld UI methods to inject keyboard handling
- **Helper classes** (`*Helper.cs`) - Utility functions for common operations

### State Management System

All state classes (`*State.cs`) are static singletons that persist across game sessions. They typically include:
- `IsActive` - Boolean flag indicating if the state is currently handling input
- Navigation tracking (current selection, available options)
- Methods: `Open()`, `Close()`, `SelectNext()`, `SelectPrevious()`, `ExecuteSelected()`
- Screen reader integration via `TolkHelper.Speak()` for direct speech output

**Key State Classes:**
- `MenuNavigationState` - Main menu navigation
- `MapNavigationState` - In-game map tile cursor
- `WorldNavigationState` - World map tile navigation (F8 view)
- `SettlementBrowserState` - Settlement filtering and selection (S key on world map)
- `PawnSelectionState` - Pawn selection and cycling
- `ArchitectState` - Build menu (categories → tools → materials → placement)
- `ZoneCreationState` - Zone drawing mode
- `WorkMenuState` - Work priority UI
- `StorageSettingsMenuState` - Storage filter configuration
- `ScannerState` - Map item scanner with hierarchical categories and subcategories (always available via Page Up/Down)
- `NotificationMenuState` - Notification viewer for messages, letters, and alerts (L key)
- `DialogNavigationState` - Generic dialog navigation (handles all Dialog_NodeTree instances including research completion)
- `CaravanFormationState` - Caravan formation dialog (selecting pawns, items, and supplies)
- `WindowlessFloatMenuState` - Generic context menu handler
- `WindowlessPauseMenuState` - In-game pause menu
- `WindowlessSaveMenuState` - Save/load file selection
- `WindowlessOptionsMenuState` - Settings menu
- `WindowlessConfirmationState` - Yes/no confirmations

### Unified Input Handling

`UnifiedKeyboardPatch.cs` is the central keyboard input handler:
- Patches `UIRoot.UIRootOnGUI` at the Prefix level with High priority
- Processes all keyboard events before RimWorld's native input handling
- Implements priority system: confirmation dialogs → menus → gameplay shortcuts
- Calls `Event.current.Use()` to consume events and prevent default game behavior

**Input Priority Order:**
1. Delete confirmations
2. General confirmations
3. Save/load menu
4. Pause menu
5. Options menu
6. Scanner (J key)
7. Float menus (order-giving)
8. Escape key (open pause menu)
9. ] key (give orders to selected pawns)

**Note:** Dialog navigation (including research completion dialogs) is handled separately by `DialogAccessibilityPatch`, which patches `Dialog_NodeTree.DoWindowContents` directly rather than going through UnifiedKeyboardPatch.

### Harmony Patching Strategy

The mod uses multiple patching approaches:

**1. Prefix Patches** - Run before original method, used for:
- Input interception (UnifiedKeyboardPatch)
- Rebuilding UI structures that are created in local scope (MainMenuAccessibilityPatch)
- Canceling default behavior via `Event.current.Use()`

**2. Postfix Patches** - Run after original method, used for:
- Drawing visual highlights for selected items
- Initializing state after UI is constructed
- Injecting additional UI elements

**3. Reflection Usage**:
- `AccessTools.Method()` - Get references to private methods
- `AccessTools.Field()` - Access private fields
- Used heavily when RimWorld's UI structures aren't publicly accessible

### Screen Reader Integration

**TolkHelper.cs** - Direct screen reader communication via Tolk library
- Provides direct integration with NVDA, JAWS, and other screen readers
- Uses P/Invoke to call native Tolk.dll functions
- Supports speech priority levels (Low, Normal, High) for interruption control
- Falls back to SAPI (Windows built-in TTS) if no screen reader detected
- Implements direct NVDA communication fallback if Tolk detection fails

**Implementation Details:**
- `TolkHelper.Initialize()` - Loads Tolk and detects active screen reader
- `TolkHelper.Speak(text, priority)` - Sends text to screen reader
  - `SpeechPriority.Low` - Non-interrupting (navigation)
  - `SpeechPriority.Normal` - Default priority
  - `SpeechPriority.High` - Interrupts previous speech (errors, warnings)
- Direct NVDA fallback via `nvdaControllerClient64.dll` if Tolk fails to detect NVDA
- Every navigation action, menu selection, and status change speaks via TolkHelper

**Required DLLs:**
- `Tolk.dll` - Screen reader bridge library (120 KB)
- `nvdaControllerClient64.dll` - NVDA controller client for direct communication (150 KB)

### Audio Feedback System

The mod supports two approaches for audio feedback:

**1. Built-in Game Sounds (Recommended)**
- Use RimWorld's existing sound library via `SoundDefOf`
- No setup required, works immediately
- Examples: `SoundDefOf.Click`, `SoundDefOf.Tick_Tiny`, `SoundDefOf.TabOpen`
- Usage: `SoundDefOf.Click.PlayOneShotOnCamera();`

**2. Embedded Custom Sounds (Advanced)**
- Custom audio files can be embedded directly into the DLL
- Configured via `rimworld_access.csproj:7-12` (EmbeddedResource items)
- Audio files placed in project `Sounds/` folder are compiled into the DLL at build time
- No external files needed for deployment - sounds are inside the DLL binary

**EmbeddedAudioHelper.cs** - Custom audio loading and playback
- `LoadEmbeddedAudio(string resourcePath)` - Loads embedded audio file from DLL resources
- `PlayEmbeddedSound(string resourcePath, float volume)` - Loads and plays embedded audio
- Supports WAV format (16-bit PCM) with manual parsing
- OGG support is limited (requires workarounds due to Unity's async loading requirements)
- Uses reflection to extract embedded resources via `Assembly.GetManifestResourceStream()`
- Bypasses RimWorld's sound system, plays directly via Unity's `AudioSource` component

**Adding Custom Sounds:**
1. Place `.wav` files in project's `Sounds/` folder (e.g., `Sounds/navigate.wav`)
2. Build project - files are automatically embedded via MSBuild
3. Use: `EmbeddedAudioHelper.PlayEmbeddedSound("navigate.wav", 0.5f);`

**Recommended Format:** 16-bit PCM WAV files for best compatibility

**Design Philosophy:**
- Audio feedback provides **timing and context cues** (navigation, mode changes, confirmations)
- TolkHelper integration provides **content and speech** (menu labels, status, descriptions)
- Hybrid approach: non-speech audio + direct screen reader output

### Map Navigation System

**MapNavigationState + MapNavigationPatch**:
- Arrow keys move a virtual cursor across map tiles
- Cursor position stored as `IntVec3` (RimWorld's 3D integer coordinate type)
- Announces tile terrain, buildings, items, and pawns at cursor position
- Enter key at cursor position opens context menu for selected pawns
- Camera automatically follows cursor movement via `Find.CameraDriver.JumpToCurrentMapLoc()`

### Architect (Build) Menu Flow

**ArchitectState + ArchitectMenuPatch**:
1. Press **A** → Open category menu (Orders, Structure, Production, etc.)
2. Select category → Open tool menu (Wall, Door, Bed, etc.)
3. Select tool → If requires material, open material menu (Wood, Steel, etc.)
4. Select material → Enter placement mode
5. **ArchitectPlacementPatch** handles arrow key placement:
   - Arrow keys: Navigate placement cursor
   - Space: Place building at cursor position
   - Shift+Space: Cancel blueprint at cursor position
   - R: Rotate building
   - Enter: Confirm and exit placement mode
   - Escape: Cancel and exit placement mode

### Zone Management

- Two-level navigation system:
  1. **List View** - Browse all notifications with Up/Down arrows
  2. **Detail View** - Press Enter to see full explanation and additional details
- Each notification announces:
  - Type (Message/Letter/Alert)
  - Label/title text
  - Full explanation text (for letters and alerts)
  - Jump target availability
- **Jump-to-target** functionality:
  - In detail view, press Enter again to jump camera to the notification's target location
  - Automatically updates map cursor position if MapNavigationState is initialized
  - Closes menu after jumping
- **Navigation**:
  - Up/Down: Navigate through notifications (in list view) or scroll explanation text (in detail view)
  - Enter: Open detail view (from list) or jump to target (from detail)

- `EmbeddedAudioHelper` - Load and play custom audio files embedded in DLL
- `PawnInfoHelper` - Pawn data extraction
- `TileInfoHelper` - Map tile information
- `ArchitectHelper` - Build menu construction
- `ScannerHelper` - Scanner item collection and categorization

### Entry Point
- `rimworld_access.cs` - MelonMod initialization

### Build Configuration
- `rimworld_access.csproj` - Project file with:
  - Dependencies (MelonLoader, Harmony, Unity, Assembly-CSharp)
  - Native DLL deployment (Tolk.dll, nvdaControllerClient64.dll)
  - Post-build target to copy all DLLs to RimWorld Mods folder
  - Release target to package DLLs and readme into release folder
  - Embedded resource configuration for `Sounds/**/*.wav`, `*.ogg`, `*.mp3` files

## Development Notes

- The mod logs to MelonLoader console via `LoggerInstance.Msg()` and RimWorld's `Log.Message()`
- All patches apply automatically via `harmony.PatchAll()` - no manual registration needed
- State persists across UI redraws, but menus are reconstructed each frame
- RimWorld uses Unity IMGUI (Immediate Mode GUI) - UI is redrawn every frame
- Event consumption via `Event.current.Use()` is critical to prevent default game behavior
- Harmony patches can stack - use `[HarmonyPriority]` attribute to control execution order
- The game runs at `Current.ProgramState` - check for `ProgramState.Playing` vs `ProgramState.Entry` (main menu)
- `Find.*` provides access to game managers: `Find.CurrentMap`, `Find.Selector`, `Find.WindowStack`, `Find.CameraDriver`

## Key RimWorld Types

- `IntVec3` - 3D integer coordinate (primary tile coordinate type)
- `Pawn` - Characters (colonists, animals, enemies)
- `Thing` - Physical objects in the world
- `Building` - Constructed structures
- `Map` - Current game map
- `FloatMenuOption` - Context menu option
- `Designator` - Build tool or order type
- `DesignationCategoryDef` - Category in architect menu
- `BuildableDef` - Definition for buildable structures
- `ThingDef` - Definition for things (materials, items, etc.)
