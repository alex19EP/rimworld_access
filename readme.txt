WORK MENU (Press Alt+W)
-----------------------
Manage colonist work assignments with support for both simple mode and manual priorities.

Common Controls:
Up/Down       Navigate work types (stops at top/bottom)
Tab           Switch to next colonist
Shift+Tab     Switch to previous colonist
M             Toggle between simple mode and manual priorities mode
Enter         Save all changes and close
Escape        Cancel changes and close

Simple Mode (toggle work types on/off):
Space         Toggle selected work type enabled/disabled

Manual Priority Mode (assign priority numbers 1-4):
0-4           Set priority directly (0=disabled, 1=highest, 4=lowest)
Space         Quick toggle between disabled and default (priority 3)
Shift+Up      Move work type up in priority order (affects execution when priorities equal)
Shift+Down    Move work type down in priority order (affects execution when priorities equal)

Notes:
- In manual priority mode, lower numbers execute first (1 before 2 before 3 before 4)
- Work types with the same priority number use list order as tiebreaker
- Changes are marked as "(pending)" until you press Enter to save
- Column reordering (Shift+Up/Down) affects all colonists globally.  As far as I am aware, this is an unavoidable quirk of the game's logic, and not something I can change.
