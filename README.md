# RimWorld Access

Screen reader accessibility for RimWorld. Uses the Tolk library to communicate with NVDA, JAWS, and other screen readers. Falls back to Windows SAPI if no screen reader is detected.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Harmony (Required Dependency)

**Steam Users:**
1. Subscribe to Harmony on Steam Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2009463077

**Non-Steam Users:**
1. Download the latest Harmony release from: https://github.com/pardeike/HarmonyRimWorld/releases/latest
2. Extract the Harmony folder to your RimWorld Mods directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\Mods\`)

### Step 2: Install RimWorld Access

1. Download the latest RimWorld Access release
2. Extract the `RimWorldAccess` folder to your RimWorld Mods directory (same location as Harmony above)

The folder structure should look like:
```
Mods\
├── RimWorldAccess\
│   ├── About\
│   │   └── About.xml
│   ├── Assemblies\
│   │   └── rimworld_access.dll
│   ├── Tolk.dll
│   └── nvdaControllerClient64.dll
└── Harmony\  (if installed manually)
```

### Step 3: Enable the Mods

Since RimWorld's mod menu is not accessible with a screen reader, you must manually edit the mods configuration file.

1. Close RimWorld if it is running
2. Open the ModsConfig.xml file in a text editor. The file is located at:
   `C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Config\ModsConfig.xml`
   (You can also type `%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Config\` in File Explorer's address bar)
3. Find the `<activeMods>` section
4. Add the following two lines at the beginning of the list, immediately after `<activeMods>`:
   ```xml
   <li>brrainz.harmony</li>
   <li>shane12300.rimworldaccess</li>
   ```
5. Save the file

**Example ModsConfig.xml after editing:**
```xml
<ModsConfigData>
  <version>1.6.4633 rev1261</version>
  <activeMods>
    <li>brrainz.harmony</li>
    <li>shane12300.rimworldaccess</li>
    <li>ludeon.rimworld</li>
    <!-- other mods and DLCs... -->
  </activeMods>
</ModsConfigData>
```
